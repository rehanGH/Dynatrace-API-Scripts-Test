This code retrieves hosts' information using the Dynatrace API. Here's a breakdown of the code and its functionality:

The code starts by importing the necessary `requests` library and sets the `base_url` for the Dynatrace API endpoint. The `api_token` variable should be replaced with the actual API token.

There are two functions defined:

- `get_hosts()` retrieves hosts' information by making a GET request to the `/entities` endpoint. It uses the entity selector and fields to specify the required data. The function paginates through the response to handle large datasets and collects the host details in a list.

- `get_monitoring_modes()` extracts the unique monitoring modes from the collected hosts' data.

The main code retrieves the hosts' information by calling `get_hosts()`. It then uses `get_monitoring_modes()` to get the unique monitoring modes from the hosts' data.

Finally, the code prints the host information, displaying the host ID, display name, and monitoring mode for each host.

Please note that the provided code is a simplified example and may require modifications to fit your specific use case or Dynatrace environment.
